# My Homelab Documentation

## Purpose

This repository serves as comprehensive documentation for my homelab setup, tracking the complete network infrastructure from the ISP connection all the way through to the end devices on my network.

## Overview

The goal is to document every layer of my homelab infrastructure, including:

- **ISP Connection**: Internet service provider details, modem configuration, and edge connectivity
- **Network Layer**: Router configuration, firewall rules, VLANs, and network segmentation
- **Core Infrastructure**: Switches, access points, and networking equipment
- **Server Infrastructure**: Physical and virtual servers, storage systems
- **Services & Applications**: Self-hosted services, containers, and applications
- **Security**: Network security, authentication, monitoring, and access control
- **Monitoring & Management**: Observability tools, logging, and management interfaces
- **Devices**: End-user devices and IoT equipment on the network

## Documentation Approach

This documentation will be built incrementally, with each component tracked as GitHub issues representing discrete tasks. This allows for:

- Clear tracking of documentation progress
- Organized breakdown of complex infrastructure
- Historical record of configuration decisions
- Easy navigation and reference

## Status

This project is currently in the planning phase. Issues will be created to track each documentation task as we build out the complete picture of the homelab infrastructure.
